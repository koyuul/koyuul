Hi! I'm Kyle!

I am a web developer, specializing in the front-end, but I'm also comfortable with the full MERN stack. I am learning C++ through satellite development, with SJSU's Cube³ Satellite Develompent Club.

Feel free to reach me at @koyuul on Instagram, or at https://koyuul.github.io/.

Nice to meet you!
