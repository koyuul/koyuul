Hi! I'm Kyle!

I am a full stack developer, specializing in front-end. I'm comfortable with the full MERN stack, and C++. I currently mainly do satellite development, with SJSU's Cube³ Satellite Develompent Club, in which I serve as the President. I also develop satellites with TechEdSat at NASA, as an intern.

Feel free to reach me at @koyuul on Instagram, or at https://koyuul.github.io/.

Nice to meet you!
